# machine_learning_MIT

Code for the online course "Machine Learning with Python: from Linear Models to Deep Learning" provided by MIT. The course consisted in lectures, theoretical exercises and projects and it was about linear classification, linear regression, non linear models, feed-forward NNs, RNNs, CNNs, unsupervised learning and RL.
